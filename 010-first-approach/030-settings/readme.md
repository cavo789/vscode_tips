# Settings {#discovering-settings}

There are two sorts of settings: `User` or `Workspace`. Remember, you can quickly access settings thanks the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>,</kbd shortcut.

 `User` settings are for all your projects and stored in the `%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json` file.

 `Workspace` settings are the opened project and stored in the `.vscode/settings.json` file (in the project's structure).
