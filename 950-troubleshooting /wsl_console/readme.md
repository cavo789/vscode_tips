# Starting code from the WSL console is not returning to the console

The problem: running `code .` from the console, in WSL2, start vscode but is not returning to the console so we can't type any others commands until we close vscode which is really annoying.

The solution is: just install the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension in vscode.
