# Snippet-creator {#extensions-snippet-creator}

The [snippet-creator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nikitaKunevich.snippet-creator) extension simplifies the creation of a snippet from existing code. Simply select the code already present in a file and then do a <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>-<kbd>P</kbd>, type `Create Snippet` to call the wizard.

*Note: the extension is actually deprecated (may 2020).*
