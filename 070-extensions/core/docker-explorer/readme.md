This extension will allows you to code inside a container, what Microsoft called `Remote containers`.

You'll need to have a `.devcontainer.json` file for this (see [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)).

When installed, as soon as the `devcontainer.json` file is detected by vscode, you'll be prompted to reopen the project remotely. You can also press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>-<kbd>P</kbd> to open the *Command Palette* and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.
