# Using vscode on the web {#vscode-dev}

Visual Studio code can be used directly from the web i.e. nothing to install on your machine.

Go to [https://vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) to start the journey.

You can also go to any github repository like f.i. [https://github.com/cavo789/vscode_tips](https://github.com/cavo789/vscode_tips) and edit the URL: add `vscode.dev/` as the domain name so edit the URL so it becomes [https://vscode.dev/github.com/cavo789/vscode_tips](https://vscode.dev/github.com/cavo789/vscode_tips). That repository will be opened in vscode.dev.

Even stronger: press the **dot** touch on your keywoard, vscode will also be opened. Here, the URL will be [https://github.dev/cavo789/vscode_tips](https://github.dev/cavo789/vscode_tips) (and not vscode.dev/). See the youtube demo at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywUZOOzLX3c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywUZOOzLX3c).
