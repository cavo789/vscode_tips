# Window settings {#settings-window}

When you open a file and then open another one without modifying the first one, the editor will open the second file in the same tab; the first file will then be closed.

If you want to open each time in a new tab, you have to adapt the parameter below:

```json
<!-- concat-md::include "./files/openFilesInNewWindow.json"  -->
```

Changes the zoom level:

```json
<!-- concat-md::include "./files/zoomLevel.json"  -->
```
